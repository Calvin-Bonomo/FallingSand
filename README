THIS WON'T COMPILE!!!

I spent a lot of time relearning C++. I tought it would be like riding a bike and it really wasn't. I'm getting fairly close 
to being done with implementing OpenGL constructs as objects, but I'm trying to be not awful about the vertex array object. A
significant amount of work has been put into the python scripts where all the computations really happen. I think it will be
pretty doable to finish this up, as most of the rest of the work is copy and pasting from the old code using my new cpp code.
